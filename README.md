# Neutrino List Builder
[Click here for an online demo!](https://flvinny.github.io/neutrinoListBuilderWeb) Or [download the .html file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flvinny/neutrinoListBuilderWeb/refs/heads/main/index.html)!

Re-implementation in vanilla JS of the list builder bundled with the [XEB+ Neutrino launcher plugin](https://github.com/sync-on-luma/xebplus-neutrino-loader-plugin). Designed as a self-contained .html file, with no external dependancies, ready to be downloaded and stored onto a flash drive.

This webapp will create a text file used by the Neutrino launcher listing the games available on a given device, to then be loaded on a modded PS2 console. See the Neutrino launcher's README for more information.
